// web-coop-keys: "Leave site?" while there is a game to lose. Outside fullscreen no page can stop Ctrl+W (Counter-Strike
// crouch + walk forward) from closing the tab; while this guard is armed the browser asks first instead of closing at
// once. One guard per page, shared by single player and multiplayer:
//   arm(why)     there is something to lose from now on (play.js: the game was entered; coop.js: in a lobby)
//   disarm(why)  not any more (play.js: the page's own error screen is up)
//   leave()      the page itself navigates now (Reload, Rejoin, Try again, Back, Quit): no question, and none later
// The question is the browser's own text, and browsers only show it once the player has clicked or typed on the page.
// The listener exists only while armed (a page that always listens for beforeunload is kept out of the back/forward
// cache). onAsk runs just before the question (play.js lets go of the held keys: the page is frozen while it is up).
// Other modules and the tests reach the same object as globalThis.__kisakLeaveGuard (landing.js and engine.js call
// leave() through it, so a page without a game fetches nothing for it).
