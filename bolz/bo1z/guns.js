// The mod id is the name of its folder in a pack (mods/cstest/...); a pack without those files never offers it.
// The start arguments are Play-CS-Zombies.bat's: the mod as fs_game (its own maps/_zombiemode_ffotd.gsc calls the
// mode's script; under fs_mods the stack's copy of that file would win and the mode would not start), the three mode
// dvars, and the mod's key binds. The engine keeps a per-fs_game player config (players/mods/cstest/config.cfg,
// Com_PlayerConfigPath), so the CS binds never reach the normal game's players/config.cfg.
// Not passed: cg_fov 90 and kisak_hitchlog 25 of the bat (a view preference and a native profiling log).

// before it can look at the pack (static initialisers run before OPFS is mounted), so the page says it is there.
